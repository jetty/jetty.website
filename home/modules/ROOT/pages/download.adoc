== What Version Do I Use?

Jetty 12 is the only community-supported version of Jetty and has many improvements over previous releases.

While many people continue to use older versions of Jetty like 11/10/9 for a variety of reasons, we recommend using Jetty 12

Jetty 12 is the only version that will receive support to the open-source community. It represents the version of Jetty that we will actively maintain and improve over the next few years.

January 1st, 2024 marks the end of community support for the Jetty 11 and older releases.
