== Open Source Support

=== Mailing Lists
Mailing lists are an excellent way to interact with the community and have the best chance of achieving a resolution for a particular class of issues. A few mailing lists are available for the Jetty project. When choosing between the developer and user lists, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself who the audience is. If your question is broadly interesting to the community, you can just use the user's list. The dev list might be better if your question or comment is narrowly focused on Jetty internals or minutiae.
