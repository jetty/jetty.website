Mailing Lists
Mailing lists are an excellent way to interact with the community and have the best chance of achieving a resolution for a particular class of issues. A few mailing lists are available for the Jetty project. When choosing between the developer and user lists, a good rule of thumb is to ask yourself who the audience is. If your question is broadly interesting to the community, you can just use the user's list. The dev list might be better if your question or comment is narrowly focused on Jetty internals or minutiae.

Github: Issues and Features
While not necessarily a support channel for solving a specific user problem, the issue tracker for Eclipse Jetty is a great location for addressing issues or suggesting features you want to see (or ideally contribute) in Jetty.

When you file a GitHub Issue in the Eclipse Jetty project, several labels are available, and we would like to encourage you to use them appropriately.

[Issues at Github](http://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project)

We have additionally identified and labeled many issues that may be appropriate for users of different levels of expertise who might want to contribute to Jetty but not have a specific goal or issue in mind.
